# How I worked on this project

I feel REACT really shines with SPAs and thought a clothing retail site would be an excellent choice for an SPA.
- I collected images for a small JSON database used by the site.
- The component nature of REACT really made organizing and developing easy for this application. 
- REACT hooks for handling state and updating components (useState, useContext, useRef) were a blessing, not only performance-wise, but development-wise, regarding page functionality. The Shopping bag was a perfect example of that. They made handling that logics very clean, tidy, and reliable.
- REACT ROUTER made switching pages easy and snappy.
