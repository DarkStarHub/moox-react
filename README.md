# How I worked on this project

I feel REACT really shines with SPAs and thought a clothing retail site would be an excellent choice for an SPA.
- I collected images for a small JSON database used by the site. All of the logic that drives the elements draws from and utilizes that database. 
- The component nature of REACT really made organizing and developing easy for this application. Simple components were created, reused and compounded with other elements throughout the app.
- REACT hooks for handling state and updating components (useState, useContext, useRef) were a blessing, not only performance-wise, but development-wise, regarding page functionality. The Shopping bag was a perfect example of that. They made handling that logic very clean, tidy, and reliable.
- REACT hooks and local storage were used for the shopping bag
- REACT ROUTER made switching pages easy and snappy.
- REACT deployment and cross browser compatibility were a cinch. Love working in REACT.
